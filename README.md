# 👋 Hi, I'm [Jey](http://github.com/jey-exp)

I am a **Computer Science Engineer** with a passion for software development, marketing, and helping people build their brand and online presence. 

## About Me

- 💻 I love **experimenting** with tech and solving problems. Whether it's building software, taking apart a laptop, or making a USB bootable drive, I get a dopamine hit from trying out new things!
- 🔧 I enjoy **hands-on work**. I recently made an Arch Linux bootable USB, installed Chrome OS Flex on my sister’s old potato PC, and even disassembled and reassembled my laptop to fix an issue with hardware.
- 🌱 I'm a **Linux lover**, using it for about a year, but already hooked on the simplicity and power it provides.
- 🖥️ I have done **three internships**—two in **UI/UX Design** and one in **backend development**.
- 🎯 I prefer **quality over quantity**. When I solve problems (like on LeetCode), I make sure I deeply understand the solution to apply it elsewhere with ease.

## Interests

- **Software Building**: I enjoy creating efficient, well-structured apps and systems.
- **Video Editing**: Crafting visuals that tell stories is another creative side of me.
- **Marketing & Branding**: I help people shape their public image and online presence.
- **Content Research**: Diving into data and extracting useful insights is my thing!

## What I’m Working On

- **Experimenting** with new technologies and ideas—whether big or small, I love learning through doing.
- **Helping others** build their online presence, whether through coding, content, or branding.

## Fun Fact

I solve very few LeetCode problems, but I dive deep into understanding each one. That way, solving the rest becomes easier!
